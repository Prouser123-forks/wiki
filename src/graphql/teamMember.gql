# Define (override the auto-generated) the type for TeamMember

# Opt out of type inferrance using @dontInfer
# (https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/graphql-data-layer/schema-customization/#opting-out-of-type-inference)
# This means we must explicitly provide typedefs for each field.
# The effect of this is that extra keys will be ignored by GraphQL.
