While I have never seen anyone do so much work for something they seem so dispassionate about, Ryan's contribution to iGEM has been invaluable, pioneering the project from the beginning. In the process of trying to be more like Julian Chen, he has achieved much in his time in iGEM. Following in the footsteps of who he believes to be the greatest leader of all time, Ryan has ruled CLS iGEM with an iron fist. He has told many lies: that he doesn't need a calculator, that he'd be 'happy' to help and that Luke Wallis's prediction wouldn't come true. Accidental flirting seems to come incredibly naturally to him, and the rest of the time he enjoys diplomatically scheming with Zac on the café balcony like he's the best thing since sliced bread. Full Windsor's have never looked so dapper, but given our school uniform is not Tommy Hilfiger, the jury's still out over whether he's a fan. Ryan's music taste is archaic; from his love of the Dancing Queen to the band Queen, he refuses to move into the current century. Outside of the classroom, Ryan watches Formula One religiously, and he's just hoping the colour of our iGEM medal this year is better than the participation one Mercedes will receive this season.

Whether he is playing his oboe in harmony with the rest of the school orchestra, or marching in unison with the rest of the CCF, whether he is solving near-impossible BMO questions or streamlining his discourse to almost NPC-like levels of purity, David is always logical, always ordered, and (like his GCSE grades) always perfect.  Although this attitude may have taken its toll on his sense of humour, he is still a man (albeit a non-playable one) to be admired.

This project has given her the freedom to peruse peer-reviewed journals, improve her ability to communicate complex ideas with clarity, and pursue a greater understanding of the human body. As an aspiring medic, Irene particularly enjoyed delving deeper into biochemical pathways, homeostatic mechanisms and intricate physiology that left her awestruck.
